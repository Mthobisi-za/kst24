            <p>Over the past ten years, KST has steadfastly driven institutional and systemic change through its innovative District Whole School Development (DWSD) model. This approach, which integrates support for infrastructure, curriculum, leadership,
                and social welfare, has proven to be a powerful catalyst for educational improvement.</p>

            <p>If the educator receives the relevant training, support and learning materials and the school environment is improved through better infrastructure and improved safety methods, and leadership within the school and district offices are strengthened,
                the quality of learner results will inevitably improve.</p>

            <h2 class="js" style="text-transform: uppercase;"> Sustainability roadmap</h2>
            <p>From the outset, KST has prioritised embedding sustainability mechanisms and processes within its District Whole School Development model, recognising the programme’s defined lifespan. Sustainability strategies are integrated into every element
                of the model to ensure long-lasting benefits and impact even after the programme concludes. A critical aspect of this approach is empowering systems leaders and establishing systemic frameworks and practices across schools and district
                offices. This ensures leadership capacity is strengthened and sustained within the education system.</p>

            <h1>District Whole School Development Model</h1>
            <p>The Core of KST's Approach</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <p>
                District Whole School Development (DWSD) Model takes a comprehensive approach to education, acknowledging that a learner's experience is shaped by multiple factors. The model emphasises the importance of well-maintained school infrastructure, skilled
                and capable educators, and strong leadership and governance within schools.
            </p>
            <p>
                It also recognises the significant impact of external factors, such as the social challenges learners may face in their homes and communities, as well as the involvement of parents in the educational process. By addressing all these aspects, the DWSD
                Model aims to create an environment where learners receive a high-quality education that is not solely dependent on the classroom but is supported by a broader, more integrated system. This holistic approach has proven effective in improving
                educational outcomes and can serve as a replicable model for other districts across the country.

                PROGRAMME REVIEW
            </h1>
            <p>
                KST has successfully implemented its comprehensive District Whole School Development Model in Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and the Northern Cape, providing critical support to 109 schools—72 primary and 37 secondary. This model incorporated several essential
                components, such as stakeholder engagement and advocacy, situational analysis, and baseline data collection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through the initiative, KST facilitated learner and teacher assessments, conducted school leadership retreats, enhanced teacher development programs for both primary and secondary schools, and provided much-needed infrastructure improvements. Additionally,
                direct learner support was prioritised to ensure a well-rounded approach to education. The implementation of these interventions concluded in December 2023, marking a significant milestone in KST's efforts to improve the quality of education
                in the targeted regions. This initiative has laid the foundation for sustainable school improvement, positively impacting students, teachers, and communities.

                    <p>
                        KST played a crucial role in ensuring that schools transitioned smoothly from direct programmatic support to autonomous management of educational practices. KST closely monitored the integration of sustainability elements, ensuring that schools were prepared
                        to carry forward the practices and methodologies introduced throughout the year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Foundation Phase programs, KST coordinated final meetings between service providers, Subject Advisors, Heads of Departments (HODs), and Lead Teachers (LTs). These meetings were essential in handing over programmatic elements, ensuring that the schools
                        were fully equipped to maintain the Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) established as part of the teacher development program. The continuation of these PLCs is vital to sustaining the knowledge and skills imparted to educators
                        during the program.

                        EXTENSION PROGRAM FOR "RED" TEACHERS
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        A key area of focus during the year has been the six-month extension program, designed to support teachers categorised as "red" based on assessments conducted by JET Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E). These teachers were identified as having significant
                        gaps in both content knowledge and pedagogical practices, particularly in Mathematics and English First Additional Language (EFAL).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The extension program aimed to address these deficiencies, with a targeted focus on critical areas such as writing and language structures in EFAL, as well as improving Mathematics teaching methodologies. The program provided tailored interventions, equipping
                        educators with the skills and knowledge needed to improve learner outcomes in these core subjects.

                    <p>
                        For Grade 12 learners and their educators, service providers concluded their support programs with a focus on final exam preparation. L&T Edu-Solutions, the Grade 12 learner support service provider, implemented the “Last Push” program, which was designed
                        to offer intensive revision and support to learners taking Mathematics and Physical Sciences. This program ran throughout October and November, both at schools and in district camps, to ensure that learners were thoroughly prepared
                        for their final exams. <br> <br>   Tsebo Education Network (TEN), which provided teacher development support for Grade 12 educators, completed its engagement with teachers by the end of October. In the remaining
                        two months of the year, TEN shifted its focus to developing educational resources that will be used to support teachers in the upcoming 2024 academic year. These resources were aimed at continuing the work of improving teaching
                        quality and learner performance in Mathematics and Physical Sciences. <br><br>  The end of the 2023 academic year marks completion of implementation period for KST’s AASA programs. The efforts to ensure the sustainability of initiatives
                        have positioned schools to maintain the benefits of the District Whole School Development (DWSD) model. Through targeted teacher development, focused learner support, and the embedding of sustainable practices within schools, KST
                        has laid the groundwork for continued educational improvement. As we look ahead to 2024/25, the focus will remain on empowering educators and learners to achieve long-term success.

                    <p>
                        Since its inception, the KST programme has made remarkable strides in improving the infrastructure and learning environments in schools across South Africa. One of the key highlights of the programme is the renovation of 54 schools, which has enhanced
                        the overall educational atmosphere for both learners and educators in Limpopo. These renovations have improved classroom conditions, allowing for more conducive spaces for teaching and learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another significant achievement was the construction of 38 new ablution facilities across various schools. In many underserved communities, proper sanitation is a critical issue, and these new facilities have contributed to better health and hygiene standards
                        for learners. Importantly, 6 of these ablution cubicles were upgraded from pit latrines to modern flushing toilets, directly addressing safety and sanitation concerns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These upgrades not only improve the physical infrastructure but also foster a healthier, more supportive environment that promotes learning and personal growth. The programme’s infrastructure projects represent the final developments under KST’s AASA
                        projects, handed over by the close of the 2023/24 financial year.

            2023/24 has been a transformative year for KST as we embarked on new partnerships and consolidated our work across multiple districts. A significant highlight is the three-year contract signed with Globeleq to implement a part of the District Whole School
            Development (DWSD) model in key wind and solar farms. This partnership enabled KST to build on the success of previous interventions and expand the impact across more schools.
            <br/><br/> Through the continued efforts of stakeholders, schools, and partners, KST have achieved meaningful improvements in the quality of education delivered to learners, particularly in under-resourced areas. The focus on capacity-building,
            leadership development, and infrastructural enhancement remains central to our mission.

                <h2>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>While 2023 has been a successful year for KST, several challenges remained. The most pressing issue has been the limited timeframe for implementing large-scale interventions, particularly in districts with deeply entrenched systemic challenges.
                    However, through adaptive planning and strong partnerships, we have been able to navigate these challenges and continue delivering impactful programs.</p>

                <p>As we move into 2024, KST is committed to building on the foundation established in 2023. Our focus will remain on strengthening educational leadership, deepening our partnerships, and driving sustainable change in the schools we support.
                    With the ongoing partnership with Globeleq and other key stakeholders, we are confident in our ability to make a lasting impact on the South African education system.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>In the ongoing quest to improve education systems, one thing has become abundantly clear: leadership is the cornerstone of sustainable transformation. As a nation, South Africa faces the challenge of an education system that often struggles
                    to meet the demands of its learners. The root causes are complex, ranging from infrastructure gaps to curriculum misalignment, but one solution has proven effective time and again — empowering school leaders.</p>
                <p>As KST embarks on a new partnership with Globeleq to implement part of our District Whole School Development (DWSD) model, we are reminded of the power of school leadership to reshape the educational landscape. Leadership does not only
                    exist at the district or national level but is cultivated within individual schools, in the decisions made daily by principals, teachers, and administrators. Strong leadership drives effective teaching and learning, and more importantly,
                    it creates the foundation for long-term success.</p>

        The Leadership Deficit in Education

        <div class="container">

            <div class="text">
                <p>KST's DWSD model emphasizes instructional leadership, a concept that goes beyond administrative duties. Instructional leaders are focused on improving the quality of teaching and learning by providing teachers with the tools, support,
                    and development opportunities they need to succeed in the classroom. The model encourages school leaders to move away from being mere managers of resources and to become advocates for educational excellence.</p>
                <p>
                    Instructional leadership starts with understanding the unique challenges of each school. This is why KST's partnership with Globeleq kicks off with leadership retreats and workshops designed to provide school principals with the skills to diagnose their
                    school's needs and implement targeted solutions. The focus on leadership development ensures that even after KST and Globeleq have concluded their direct involvement, these leaders will continue to drive change.</p>

                <p>School leadership cannot thrive in isolation. District-level leadership and support structures play a critical role in sustaining the progress made at individual schools. KST’s model also focuses on capacitating district officials to ensure
                    they are equipped to provide continuous guidance and oversight. A symbiotic relationship between schools and district offices ensures that school leaders are not alone in their pursuit of better outcomes.</p>
                <p>
                    This holistic approach is why the DWSD model integrates stakeholder engagement from the onset. By aligning the efforts of schools, districts, and the broader community, we create an ecosystem where leadership is distributed across multiple levels, reinforcing
