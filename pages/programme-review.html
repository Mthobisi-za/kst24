                KST has successfully implemented its comprehensive District Whole School Development Model in Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and the Northern Cape, providing critical support to 109 schools—72 primary and 37 secondary. This model incorporated several essential
                components, such as stakeholder engagement and advocacy, situational analysis, and baseline data collection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through the initiative, KST facilitated learner and teacher assessments, conducted school leadership retreats, enhanced teacher development programs for both primary and secondary schools, and provided much-needed infrastructure improvements. Additionally,
                direct learner support was prioritised to ensure a well-rounded approach to education. The implementation of these interventions concluded in December 2023, marking a significant milestone in KST's efforts to improve the quality of education

                        KST played a crucial role in ensuring that schools transitioned smoothly from direct programmatic support to autonomous management of educational practices. KST closely monitored the integration of sustainability elements, ensuring that schools were prepared
                        to carry forward the practices and methodologies introduced throughout the year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Foundation Phase programs, KST coordinated final meetings between service providers, Subject Advisors, Heads of Departments (HODs), and Lead Teachers (LTs). These meetings were essential in handing over programmatic elements, ensuring that the schools
                        were fully equipped to maintain the Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) established as part of the teacher development program. The continuation of these PLCs is vital to sustaining the knowledge and skills imparted to educators
                        during the program.

                        EXTENSION PROGRAM FOR "RED" TEACHERS

                    <p>
                        A key area of focus during the year has been the six-month extension program, designed to support teachers categorised as "red" based on assessments conducted by JET Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E). These teachers were identified as having significant
                        gaps in both content knowledge and pedagogical practices, particularly in Mathematics and English First Additional Language (EFAL).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The extension program aimed to address these deficiencies, with a targeted focus on critical areas such as writing and language structures in EFAL, as well as improving Mathematics teaching methodologies. The program provided tailored interventions, equipping
                        educators with the skills and knowledge needed to improve learner outcomes in these core subjects.

                    <p>
                        For Grade 12 learners and their educators, service providers concluded their support programs with a focus on final exam preparation. L&T Edu-Solutions, the Grade 12 learner support service provider, implemented the “Last Push” program, which was designed
                        to offer intensive revision and support to learners taking Mathematics and Physical Sciences. This program ran throughout October and November, both at schools and in district camps, to ensure that learners were thoroughly prepared
                        for their final exams. <br> <br>   Tsebo Education Network (TEN), which provided teacher development support for Grade 12 educators, completed its engagement with teachers by the end of October. In the remaining
                        two months of the year, TEN shifted its focus to developing educational resources that will be used to support teachers in the upcoming 2024 academic year. These resources were aimed at continuing the work of improving teaching
                        quality and learner performance in Mathematics and Physical Sciences. <br><br>  The end of the 2023 academic year marks completion of implementation period for KST’s AASA programs. The efforts to ensure the sustainability of initiatives
                        have positioned schools to maintain the benefits of the District Whole School Development (DWSD) model. Through targeted teacher development, focused learner support, and the embedding of sustainable practices within schools, KST
                        has laid the groundwork for continued educational improvement. As we look ahead to 2024/25, the focus will remain on empowering educators and learners to achieve long-term success.

                    <p>
                        Since its inception, the KST programme has made remarkable strides in improving the infrastructure and learning environments in schools across South Africa. One of the key highlights of the programme is the renovation of 54 schools, which has enhanced
                        the overall educational atmosphere for both learners and educators in Limpopo. These renovations have improved classroom conditions, allowing for more conducive spaces for teaching and learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another significant achievement was the construction of 38 new ablution facilities across various schools. In many underserved communities, proper sanitation is a critical issue, and these new facilities have contributed to better health and hygiene standards
                        for learners. Importantly, 6 of these ablution cubicles were upgraded from pit latrines to modern flushing toilets, directly addressing safety and sanitation concerns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These upgrades not only improve the physical infrastructure but also foster a healthier, more supportive environment that promotes learning and personal growth. The programme’s infrastructure projects represent the final developments under KST’s AASA
                        projects, handed over by the close of the 2023/24 financial year.

                2023/24 has been a transformative year for KST as we embarked on new partnerships and consolidated our work across multiple districts. A significant highlight is the three-year contract signed with Globeleq to implement a part of the District Whole School
                Development (DWSD) model in key wind and solar farms. This partnership enabled KST to build on the success of previous interventions and expand the impact across more schools.
                <br/><br/> Through the continued efforts of stakeholders, schools, and partners, KST have achieved meaningful improvements in the quality of education delivered to learners, particularly in under-resourced areas. The focus on capacity-building,
                leadership development, and infrastructural enhancement remains central to our mission.
